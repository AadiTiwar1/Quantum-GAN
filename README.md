# Quantum-GAN
Using a Quantum Long Short Term Memory model as the generator for a Generative Adversial Network used for time-series forecasting <br>
Everything should be contained inside the notebook, meaning you don't need any other files <br>
Should have pytorch, yfinance, and the basic machine learning libraries <br>
Thank you to https://github.com/DikshantDulal https://github.com/JonasTYW for creating the QLSTM model in the first place and giving advice for implementing for GAN <br>
This repository was used heavily https://github.com/ChickenBenny/Stock-prediction-with-GAN-and-WGAN <br>

In reality this notebook is just stitching together a QLSTM model and a GAN for time-series forecasting. If you want to actually learn anything, I'd recommend checking out the user profiles and repository above to learn more about what each part of the code does on its own. I'm going to try to make this notebook much more learnable from in the future, but for now this is what I have
