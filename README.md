# Quantum-GAN
Using a Quantum Long Short Term Memory model as the generator for a Generative Adversial Network used for time-series forecasting <br>
Everything should be contained inside the notebook, meaning you don't need any other files <br>
Should have pytorch, yfinance, and the basic machine learning libraries <br>
Thank you to https://github.com/DikshantDulal https://github.com/JonasTYW for creating the QLSTM model in the first place and giving advice for implementing the GAN <br>
