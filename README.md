# Quantum-GAN
Using a Quantum Long Short Term Memory model as the generator for a Generative Adversial Network used for time-series forecasting
Everything should be contained inside the notebook, meaning you don't need any other files
Should have pytorch, yfinance, and the basic machine learning libraries
Thank you to https://github.com/DikshantDulal https://github.com/JonasTYW for creating the QLSTM model in the first place and giving advice for implementing for GAN
This repository was used heavily https://github.com/ChickenBenny/Stock-prediction-with-GAN-and-WGAN

In reality this notebook is just stitching together a QLSTM model and a GAN for time-series forecasting. If you want to actually learn anything, I'd recommend checking out the user profiles and repository above to learn more about what each part of the code does on its own.
