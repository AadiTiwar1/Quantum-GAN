# Quantum-GAN
Using a Quantum Long Short Term Memory model as the generator for a Generative Adversial Network used for time-series forecasting <br>
 - The file titled "gan" contains the classical gan model. The file titled "qgan" contains the quantum gan model.<br>
 - As long as you have the libraries used in the notebooks updated to their latest versions, everything should be fine<br><br>
Thank you to [Dikshant Dulal](https://github.com/DikshantDulal) and [Jonas](https://github.com/JonasTYW) for giving advice for implementing the GAN! <br>
